## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What software is needed to be able to install packages and dependencies:
#### Requirements

- Node 8.11.x
- Yarn 1.12.x

#### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

First the user will have to have yarn and node installed on his/her device, then must run yarn and node install on the terminal in the repo and in the client folder within the repo:

```
yarn
npm install
```

Then the user will have to run the server and client by executing the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

This will run the server and the client in a development environment

## Running the tests

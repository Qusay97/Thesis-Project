# Charitable
Charitable is a platform built to help promote non-profit organizations and people who need help raising funds for a charitable cause.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Example: npm install in the client directory.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First the user will have to have yarn and node installed on his/her device, then must run yarn and node install on the terminal in the repo and in the client folder within the repo:

```
yarn
npm install
```

Then the user will have to run the server and client by executing the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

This will run the server and the client in a development environment

## Running the tests
```
npm run test
```
### Break down into end to end tests

Used database test, Chai and Mocha test for MySQL

```
Testing if user can log in
```
